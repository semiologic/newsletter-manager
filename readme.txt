A widget-driven newsletter form manager.


== Description ==

The Newsletter Manager plugin for WordPress allows you to manage newsletter subscription forms on your site.

It is widget-driven, and plays best with widget-driven themes such as the Semiologic theme, especially when combined with the Inline Widgets plugin.

The plugin plays well with aweber, getresponse, 1shoppingcart, majordomo, and other list managers that can service a list-subscribe@domain.com email.

= Placing a Subscription Form in a panel/in a sidebar =

It's short and simple:

1. Browse Appearance / Widgets
2. Open the panel of your choice (or sidebar, if not using the Semiologic theme)
3. Place a "Newsletter Widget" in that panel/sidebar
4. Configure that newsletter widget as needed

Usually, no configuration will be required beyond entering the email of your list.

Common places to insert a form automatically include:

- To the top/middle right of your site in a sidebar. Users commonly swipe their mouse to the top right corner of their screen, and eyeballs generally look for it in that area once they're done reading.
- After your post's content ("Entry: Content" widget in the "Each Entry" panel), provided of course that your content is read to the very end.
- After all posts ("After The Entries" panel.)

= Embedding a subscription form in a static page =

You'll frequently want a subscription form directly in the content of key pages on your site:

1. Open the Inline Widgets panel, under Appearance / Widgets
2. Place and configure a Newsletter Widget
3. Create or edit your pages as needed; note the "Widgets" drop down menu
4. Select your newly configured newsletter widget in the "Widgets" drop down menu to insert it where your mouse cursor is at

= Google Analytics integration =

Combining this plugin with the Google Analytics (GA) plugin adds an interesting bonus. Specifically, form subscription usage gets tracked as page events. In addition, newly subscribed users are segmented automatically.

= Help Me! =

The [Semiologic forum](http://forum.semiologic.com) is the best place to report issues.
